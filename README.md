# Correction of the solar disk images for the area calculation
*A full description of the area calculation method is described in Chikunova et al.2023*

The images of the Sun provide only a 2D representation of the actual 3D solar surface. Projection effects lead to the different weights of each pixel, e.g. closer to the limb the pixel area is larger than one closer to the Sun center. Thus, for an accurate definition of the area, we present a method to identify the surface area of a sphere for each pixel.

### Separate functions:  TBD
- to calculate the [area of 1 pixel](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Chigaga/area_calculation/blob/main/area_calculation.ipynb#scrollTo=K-T0LUOCZ-YY&line=11&uniqifier=1) 

- to calculate the [area of the region on the solar disk] 

- to create an [area map for the full solar disk image]
