# Calculation of the area of each pixel on the solar disk

The images of the Sun provide only a 2D representation of the actual 3D solar surface. Projection effects lead to the different weights of each pixel, e.g. closer to the limb the pixel area is larger than one closer to the Sun center. Thus, for an accurate definition of the area, we present a method to identify the surface area of a sphere for each pixel.
